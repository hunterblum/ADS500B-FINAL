### Description:

This was the first project I completed as part of the Applied Data Science degree at the University of San Diego. Because of this, the documentation is poor, however, I kept it because it shows my growth in the program over the past two years. The data set came from the commonly used "House Sales in King County, USA" dataset from Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction. For this project, I worked on the R portion of the notebook. I did a bit of data cleaning, including removing multi-collinear variables. Then I trained a linear and logistic regression, using some transformations along the way. I also created visualizations to evaluate which predictors should be used
and if the models were meeting their expectations.
